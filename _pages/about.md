<h1>About Me </h1> 
<div style='text-align: justify;'>I am Nikhil Cherian Kurian, a Research Fellow at the  <a href="https://adelaide.edu.au/aiml/" style="text-decoration: none;">Australian institute of Machine learning (AIML)</a> , University of Adelaide. Prior to this I was a senior AI researcher at Fujitsu Research of India Pvt Ltd (FRIPL). I completed my PhD in May 2023 from the <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of  Technology, Bombay</a>. My  PhD research was focused on introducing a range of novel deep learning based algorithms that automatically analyse cancerous tissue in H&E histology images. My expertise lies in developing robust supervision techniques for large scale medical image analysis. During my PhD, I was associated with MeDAL (Medical Imaging, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence Lab) and worked under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Amit Sethi</a>. Earlier, I obtained my Master's degree from the department of electrical engineering at <a href="https://www.iitgn.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">IIT Gandhinagar</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitgn.ac.in/nvg/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Nithin V George</a>, where I developed novel information-theoretic learning algorithms for various signal processing applications.</div>  
<p>  </p>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>During my research, I was fortunate to work and communicate with various collaborators from the perspective of broad interdisciplinary research during my PhD. In my PhD I mainly focussed on analysing and quantifying intra-tumour heterogeneity in breast cancer tissues under the mentorship of <a href="https://pathology.uic.edu/directory/peter-h-gann-mdscd/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof Peter Gann</a>, University of Illinois, Chicago.  Earlier in my PhD, I also got the opportunity to work with <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/anita-grigoriadis" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Anita Grigoriadis</a> of Kings College London, and <a href="https://actrec.irins.org/profile/171459" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof Swapnil Rane</a>, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai where we worked on solving robust pathological feature segmentation using novel deep learning pipelines to analyse breast cancer lymph nodes. I also had research assosciations with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/" style="text-decoration: none;"> Nvidia Corporation Mumbai</a> for exploratory and accelerated research in large scale histopathology problems.</div>

<br>I maintain a list of my publications under the Research tab and my full Resume is attached the CV Tab.
